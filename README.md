# Project Overview

This is the fourth project of Udacity FEND that is implementing the concept of test suites that can check your application for any failures.

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## How to run the test suites in this feed reeder application?

1. Unzip/clone this repository into your machine.
2. Review the functionality of the application within your browser.
3. You will notice 7 tests succeeded which checks your code as follows.
4. First test checks that all feeds are defined and are not null.
5. Second test loops through each feed and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
6. Third test loops through each feed and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
7. Fourth test checks that the menu element is hidden by default.
8. Fifth test ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
9. Sixth test ensures when the feeds are loaded there is at least one entry.
10. Seventh test ensures when a new feed is loaded then the content actually changes.
